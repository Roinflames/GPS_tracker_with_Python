# GPS_tracker_with_Python
The GPS Locator Using Python project is designed to fetch and display the geographical location of a user based on their IP address. The project leverages multiple Python libraries, including requests for fetching data from an API, folium for creating interactive maps, and selenium for automating the web browser to display the map.
